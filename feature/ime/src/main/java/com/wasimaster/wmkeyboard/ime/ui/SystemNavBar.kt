 * Why this exists at all, when [NavigationBarBackground] already paints the
 * band: the keyboard's window is edge to edge on every version and the board
 * — gradient, image and all — runs under the bar, but below Android 15 the
 * system still draws the bar's own background over it in the window's
 * `navigationBarColor`. Left unset that is the platform default, which on
 * some light-mode OEM builds is opaque white under a coloured keyboard
 * (issue #255).
 *
 * The default implementation does nothing, which is what the settings app's
 * theme previews want: they run in an Activity whose own window owns the bar.
